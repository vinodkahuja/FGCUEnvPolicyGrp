# Welcome to Florida Gulf Coast University

Our department is at the forefront of innovation in computing, data science, and technology research. We bring together talented faculty, dedicated students, and cutting-edge research to solve real-world problems.

## What We Do

The Policy Impact Evaluation (PIE) research is a transdisciplinary research collaboration between faculty at the Water School and the Whitaker College of Engineering at Florida Gulf Coast University. The PIE Research group seeks to foster interdisciplinary research collaboration among university faculty, postdoctoral scholars, graduate and undergraduate students at FGCU, and faculty affiliates and researchers at other universities and research institutions in Florida, elsewhere in the United States, and beyond. The research group seeks to be a hub of active research collaborations for rigorous policy impact assessments and analyses of social-ecological impacts of environmental outcomes, such as climate resilience and adaptation, climate change mitigation, environmental engineering, and ecological sustainability innovations like forestry sector participation in diverse contexts. 
The overarching goal of the PIE Research Group is to build a team that can sustain long-term research collaboration around pressing environmental sustainability and social-ecological issues pertinent to climate resilience, ecological engineering, and sustainability in Southwest Florida and elsewhere.

## Activities

The PIE research group will undertake rigorous impact assessment studies of pressing environmental outcomes such as adaptation of climate change and mitigation efforts in southwest Florida and diverse contexts. The goal is to build a team of long-term innovative research efforts around pressing issues of climate change, environmental sustainability, and food security impacts in southwest Florida and other contexts, especially in low- and middle-income countries of Africa (such as Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Malawi), and Brazil, Guatemala, Uganda, Pakistan, and India. 
The group utilizes primary and secondary survey datasets to explore possibilities for understanding the dynamics of various sustainability policy outcomes in southwest Florida and elsewhere. The research group will undertake the following specific activities:
-	Training workshops for exploring various survey datasets and the best methods for data handling and manipulation.
-	Follow-up workshop on data visualization and initial results 
-	Virtual seminar for results sharing and high-quality manuscripts for publication in high-impact journals.
-	To create a forum for the delivery of research findings to ease uptake by policymakers and practitioners in diverse contexts.
