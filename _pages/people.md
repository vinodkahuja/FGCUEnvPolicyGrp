# Our Team

Meet the talented individuals behind our department.

### Dr. Festus Amadu 
Dr. Festus Amadu is an Assistant Professor of Climate Policy in the Department of Ecology and Environmental Studies at the Water School at FGCU. He joined FGCU in Fall 2023. Dr. Amadu’s research and teaching focus on understanding the causal effects of key policies and how these policy-driven outcomes lead to sustainable impacts across different contexts. Since joining FGCU in 2023, Dr. Amadu has launched the development of a Policy Impact Evaluation Group, a transdisciplinary team dedicated to conducting rigorous impact assessments of various policies, including climate resilience, mitigation, and just transition efforts, at multiple spatial scales in southwest Florida and beyond. He earned his Ph.D. in Natural Resources and Environmental Sciences, with a focus on Environmental Economics, from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2018. Before arriving at Florida Gulf Coast University, Dr. Amadu was a Postdoctoral Research Scholar at the University of Notre Dame, where he worked on international development issues related to forest conservation and food and livelihood security in Africa. Prior to his Ph.D., he earned two master’s degrees in Agricultural Economics: one from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in 2014, and another from Njala University in Sierra Leone, where he also received his Bachelor of Science in Agricultural Economics. 
Dr. Amadu serves as the Principal Investigator on several ongoing projects associated with the Research group. Some of these include the Impact of Electronic Vouchers on Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) and Food Security in Sierra Leone (funded by the International Growth Center at the London School of Economics, United Kingdom), 2). The Climate Evidence Gap Mapping (EGM) for the CSA in climate policy in the low- and middle-income countries, funded through the Water School and the Work in Scholarly Education and Research (WiSER) program at FGCU, 3). The Lake Okeechobee Dynamic Modelling Project for Sustainable Fishing project, funded in part by the Florida Department of the Environment.
