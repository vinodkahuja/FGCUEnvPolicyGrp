# Research Projects

Explore our current and completed research projects.

## Current Projects
1.	The Impact of Electronic Vouchers on Climate Smart Agriculture (CSA) and Food Security in Sierra Leone.
2.	Climate Evidence Gap Mapping (EGM) for the CSA in climate policy in the low- and middle-income countries. 
3.	Lake Okeechobee project
4.	Decade of Action Project
5.	Liberia Forest Policy Project
6.	Malawi CSA analysis

## Proposed benefits and desired outputs
This project will enhance vertical collaboration between faculty across the Water School and Whitaker College of Engineering at FGCU, and other departments elsewhere to undertake environmental sustainability and ecological impact assessment and research in southwest Florida and elsewhere. Specifically, we seek to achieve the following specific outputs: 
-	Enhanced collaboration between FGCU faculty, postdocs, and graduate and undergraduate students in impact assessment research on sustainability outcomes, such as forest sector participation.
-	Joint supervision of graduate and undergraduate students.

## Anticipated outcomes
-	Research articles on environmental impact data on forest-related outcomes across African countries (like Liberia, Malawi, and Uganda) and Asian countries like Bhutan.
-	Drafts of manuscripts on environmental social sciences and ecological impact assessments using Living Standards Measurement Surveys and in-country datasets from sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America.
-	An up-to-date website that demonstrates comparative results of environmental impact outcomes across diverse contexts.  

## Existing capacities and strengths
The team has extensive research experience and a passion for capacity building in low- and middle-income countries across diverse regions of sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, and Central America. We have collaborated on several prior and ongoing projects at different spatial scales in different capacities. Therefore, the formation of the PIE-Research Group serves to build on such previous and ongoing collaborations to enhance mutual research productivity.
